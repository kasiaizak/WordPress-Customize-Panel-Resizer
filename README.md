## LastPass Hide Ads

## Photopea Hide Ads

Userscript to hide ads and resize working area on Photopea (minimum screen width recommended: 900px).

Script created for testing the program (ads make the workspace a bit too small, especially on smaller screens). If you like Photopea and intend to use it regularly, I encourage you to support the author of the project by purchasing a Premium subscription. The subscription removes ads, but also increases the number of steps available in history.
